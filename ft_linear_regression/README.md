# ft_linear_regression

The goal of this project is to introduce us to the basic concepts of ML.
We have to implement a program that predicts the price of a car by using a linear function trained with a gradient descent algorithm.

We were totally free on what langage to use, I decided to go with Python as I'm trying to get more proefficient coding in Python, especially while working with data.

**Final note: 125%.**
